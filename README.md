### Currently working on:
- Moving to a "proper" back-end (Node, Express, PostgreSQL) hosted on Heroku. Currently the front-end of the app is hosted on Github Pages. The back-end is simply a MongoDB database hosted by Back4App and the front-end interacts with the database through their API. This means I don't have to write any database queries, or pretty much any server side code at all. Basically, a lot of the back-end stuff has been done for me. If I stick with this low-code solution, I would be missing out on a great opportunity to learn what really goes on in the back-end of a web app. Besides that, low code solutions can really restrict the amount of things you can do (see: website builders). So that's my justification on moving to a proper backend.


### TODO
- User accounts
- Move to a front-end framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- refactor CSS
- optimize canvasView renders
- polymorphism of shape types to eliminate duplicate code
- add ability to delete objects
- info page
- figure out how to save image of the canvas to the server
